        <h1>Hi, I'm Izzy!</h1>
        <p>I'm a web producer at USF. I aspire to be a front-end web developer, which is why I'm taking CNIT 132A. I like learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I can build websites. In my free time, I enjoy learning Japanese, biking in Golden Gate Park, and making matcha lattes.</p>

        <p>P.S. This website is still very much in the works. I hope to make it look better as time progresses!</p>
